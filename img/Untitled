TASK #1:

Enter a bio about yourself. Make it personal but professional at the same time. You should write a few short paragraphs outlining your current professional 
experience. Write around 500 words (for Search Engine Optimization reasons, your website should contain more than 1500 words).


TASK #2:
In the experience section, add your work experience. Add a minimum of three jobs and If you don't have much job experience, feel free to list clubs or 
organizations you've been a part of. Even volunteer work could qualify. If you have more than three entries, feel free to list them all. You can copy and 
paste each div class to add more sections, or you can remove sections if you don't have much work experience. Use your best judgment on this section, and 
reference back to the other Learn CS8 labs if you need help with HTML formatting.
